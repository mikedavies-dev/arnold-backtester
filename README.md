# Arnold ðŸ’ª - Stock/Crypto Backtesting Platform

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/ant-fx/arnold-backtester/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=1CF7QD9N5O)](https://codecov.io/gh/ant-fx/arnold-backtester)

The ethos behind Arnold is to allow for advanced backtesting of stocks using
tick and bid/ask data and provide a different order types like:

- Market
- Limit
- Stoploss (Trailing + Fixed)
- Bracket

It will also let you load other symbol data at the same time, for example you
could check the `SPY` while trading `MSFT`.

It should let you graphically analyse each trade in context to better help
understand the strategy.

## Sample Profile

```json
{
  "strategy": "sample",
  "initialBalance": 10000,
  "commissionPerOrder": 1,
  "dates": {
    "from": "2021-12-01",
    "to": "2021-12-03"
  },
  "symbols": ["MSFT"]
}
```

## Sample Strategy

```typescript
const shares = 100;

export function handleTick({
  tick,
  symbol,
  tracker,
  trackers,
  marketState,
  log,
  broker,
}: // accountSize - used to calculate share size
HandleTickParameters) {
  switch (tick.type) {
    case 'TRADE': {
      // Not a new high
      if (tick.value <= tracker.high) {
        return;
      }

      // We already have an open position or the market isn't open
      if (
        marketState !== 'OPEN' ||
        broker.getPositionSize(symbol) > 0 ||
        broker.hasOpenOrders(symbol)
      ) {
        return;
      }

      log(
        'Opening position on new high of day',
        symbol,
        tick.dateTime,
        tick.value,
      );

      const shares = 100;

      const buyOrderId = broker.placeOrder({
        type: 'MKT',
        shares,
        symbol,
        action: 'BUY',
      });

      // Place the trailing stop as a child of the opening order
      broker.placeOrder({
        parentId: buyOrderId,
        symbol,
        type: 'TRAIL',
        price: 0.5,
        action: 'SELL',
        shares,
      });
    }
  }
}
```

## TODO

- Cleanup project layout
- Create basic express server
- Results viewer
- Eventually move into global module via npm

### Results viewer

- Show symbols/dates/in results
- Show PnL etc in results summary list
- Show list of positions
- Show position details (4 charts, SPY 1m, stock 1m, stock 60m, stock daily) and
  entry/exit positions.
- When viewing results we should request the data from the server.

### Data loader

We need a way to load all required data before running a backtest, so the
backtest will check for required data first, downloading:

- Tick
- Minute
- Hour
- Daily

This data will then be available for the backtester and the results viewer.

Store the data in Mongo (apart from tick)?

### Next steps

1. Data loader (see above)
2. Store data in Mongo
3. Provide data to backtest (including daily, 60 mins etc)
4. Load data in results viewer
5. Add keyboard commands to see next/prev results
6. Add trade markers to results viewer
7. Add summary to results viewer (PnL, Orders, Open time, Close time, Duration)
8. Store results of calls to `log(...)` with results so we cna view them in the
   results viewer

## Ideal folder setup

- src/
  - bin/
  - backtest/
  - trader/
  - server/
    - public/
  - core/

## Metrics to add:

- Sharp ratio
- Sortino ratio
- Std div of average order PnL (and %)
- Some kind of factor from avg order PnL to std div that favors a stable
  distribution?

### Problem..

How do we load/sync minute data for all required symbols?

1. Load all minute data for all required symbols into a date indexed map
2. Iterate all minutes in day
3. For each minute look for the minute data for each symbol. If we find data
   then add it to the current bars, if we don't then find the last valid bar and
   copy it as (open=lastClose, high=lastClose, low=lastClose, close=lastClose,
   volume=0) and add to the bars

For daily/hour/5min charts we can calculate the latest value starting from the
first day.

For daily:

- Load all previous data excluding current day. Load current day's data using
  the minute date, including pre-market data

For hourly

- Load all previous data excluding current day. Load current day's data using
  the minute date, including pre-market data

For 5min

- Load all previous data excluding current day. Load current day's data using
  the minute date, including pre-market data
